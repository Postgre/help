3) Set a "Upper Limit" for the graph
You can set an upper limit for all the graphs based on a graph template, or you can set it per host. 
- Click "Graph Templates" from the left menu
- Click the graph you want to set the maximum for
- Scoll the page down to the options
- "Auto Scale" should be set off
- "Auto Scale Options" should be set to "Use --alt-autoscale-max (accepting a lower limit)"
- Set the "Upper Limit" to the number you want the graph to scale to by default, for example "4" or "8" for a load graph and "104857600" for a 100 mbit network graph. 
- If you want to set an upper limit per separate host, you need to check the checkbox "Use Per-Graph Value" below "Upper Limit"
- Click "Save"
These are my settings:
########################################################################
f you have choosen "Use Per-Graph Value", you can set the per-host value this way:
-Choose "Graph Management" for the left menu
- Click the graph
- Set the "Upper Limit"
- Click "Save"

Repeat this for all of your hosts.
